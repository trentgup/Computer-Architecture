Cooling is used to remove waste heat from the components of the computer to keep them within operating temperature limits. Components that could have permanent failure if overheated include CPU's, Chipset, Graphics Cards, and HDD's. The most common way to cool a computer is fans, but you can also use liquid cooling. Components are build to produce as little heat as possible, but cooling is still needed.
