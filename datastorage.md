Data Storage is the recording of information into a storage medium. It will require electrical power to store the data onto a data storage component. A Hard Disc Drive or HDD uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve data. A Hard Disc Drive can store data even if it loses power. A Solid State Drive or SSD unlike a hard disc drive have no mechanical components. SSD's run silently, have quicker access time and lower latency which makes them more popular than HDD.
